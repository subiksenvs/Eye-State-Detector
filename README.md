# Eye-State-Detector
The Eye State Detector uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to detect if eyes are open or closed in real-time via webcam. It calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks. If EAR &lt; 0.25, eyes are closed; otherwise, theyâ€™re open. The system overlays status and eye outlines on the video feed.
